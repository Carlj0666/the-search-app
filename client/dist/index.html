<!--
  HTML FILE:

  1.) Here is where will define the basic (albeit boilerplate) HTML setup for our MERN (react) application

  2.) I would highly recommend you look into Emmet for VS Code as it provides nice key mapping shortcuts to take care of that boilerplate for you

  3.) Essentially, you're going to want a div in the body of your html that connects to the react element with an id of "app"

  4.) Later on, you can link your css stylesheet in the <head> tag of this file

If you get stuck here, let me know and I can help

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  <div id="app">App</div>
  <script src="app.jsx" type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
